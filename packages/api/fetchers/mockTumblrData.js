He thinks about the saddle the sandbenders had thrown out when they traded Appa, about the map he packed when he ran away that fateful day; scribbled with all the places he planned to visit, about the clothes he was wearing when Azula struck him; now left tattered and torn. The anguish that he feels watching the last physical item that tied him to his old life is red hot and all-consuming, just like the flames before him. </p><p>“That’s okay,” He’d said, even when it was not. “It would give away my identity.” He tried not to think about how he was the only piece of the Air Nomads and their culture left in existence. A living relic. Aang’s identity as an airbender was the only thing he had yet to sacrifice, and he wasn’t planning on doing so anytime soon.</p><p>Which is why, when he puts on the headband for the first time, it hurts him more than he can put into words. He realizes as he closes the cloth around his forehead that there isn’t anywhere he can check for his reflection, and is grateful for the small mercy. He can’t even begin to imagine what he would look like without his tattoos.</p><p>This war, he thinks to himself. It just keeps taking and taking and taking. Aang is sure by now, as he hides his tattoos, that he no longer has any more left to give. </p><p>Still, he shakes the thoughts away and plasters on his signature lopsided smile. “Tada! Normal kid.”</p><p>He watches Toph and Sokka squabble over the earthbender’s new Fire Nation style shoes. In this instance, as she and Sokka bicker about, Aang finds that from an outsider’s perspective, they really do look like nothing but normal kids. Just a bunch of friends hanging out close to the shoreline. The minor moments of normalcy they are afforded are few and far in between, so Aang lets himself laugh wholeheartedly because he doesn’t know when he will next find this type of joy.</p><p>Katara’s voice breaks him out of his laughter. “How do I look?” She stands from head to toe in red, a nice contrast to her dark skin.</p><p>Beautiful is his first thought, because she is. The thought that follows is, “Uhh, your mom’s necklace.”</p><p>The waterbender immediately reaches up to touch the pendant at her neck. “Oh,” is all she says at first, obviously reluctant. Aang watches her unclasp and remove it anyway. “Oh yeah. I guess it’s pretty obviously Water Tribe, isn’t it?” Katara’s fist closes around the small choker, concealing the last of her true identity. Here and now, she follows the rest of them and gives into the guise of a Fire Nation citizen.</p><p>The disappointment her face mars is a painful reminder that they are all sacrificing bits of themselves for this war. That, consequently, they can all find solace in one another. Aang wonders briefly if that is a blessing or a curse.</p><p>Again he pushes this thought away. Instead, he follows his companions as they begin their trek into town.</p><p>X</p><p>It’s a slow day in town. Granted, he couldn’t really think much of it, since he and Momo somehow got roped into attending a local elementary school. The first day isn’t so bad, though Aang doesn’t remember this many customs present all those times he visited Kuzon. It takes him one too many times to get the bow right that he worries he’ll blow his cover soon. He has one of his new classmates to thank for hinting at him the proper way. Later, he learns that her name is On Ji. </p><p>Of course, when he returns to their hideout, he gets an earful from Sokka for wandering off. That doesn’t stop him from attending the next day.</p><p>But the second day is what really tests his limits. </p><p>Of all the ways to start the day, Aang never imagined staring at a portrait of the former Fire Lord Sozin being one of them. He follows the suit of the other students and stands rigidly, mouthing incorrectly to all the words of an oath he knows nothing about. The teacher catches on and is quick to punish him and his classmates with a pop quiz. This puzzles Aang even more. As if having to pledge allegiance to the very man who started the war wasn’t weird enough, the teacher adds insults to injury by starting off their quiz with:</p><p>“What year did Firelord Sozin battle the Air Nation army?”</p><p>He raises his hand almost immediately. The teacher, clearly irritated, indulges him anyway. “Is that a trick question? The Air Nomads didn’t have a formal military. Sozin defeated them by ambush.” He tries not to make it sound so defensive, instead feigning confusion. Almost all of his peers stare dumbfounded at him, but he waits for the teacher’s response anyway. These are his people they were talking about. How could they fabricate history books so blatantly? Was wiping them off the face of the earth not cruel enough?</p><p>“Well, I don’t know how you could possibly know more than our national history book, unless you were there a hundred years ago.” She clips and raises an eyebrow, as if challenging him to defy her.</p><p>The young airbender’s nervous laughter rings throughout the classroom. He wants so badly to question her further, to probe how exactly an Air Nomad <i>militia</i> came about, when it was within their ways to avoid violence at all costs. They were carefree, spontaneous, and had a spiritual weightlessness to them. But these words die on his tongue, all for the sake of keeping his identity secret. It pains him that he has no choice but to accept these lies knowing they are untrue. Though he owes it to his people to set things straight, he sits down and lets the culture of the Air Nomads once again get lost in translation. </p><p>X </p><p>It is during Music Class that he finally snaps.</p><p>He was just dancing. But the teacher had called it a “nervous disorder.”</p><p>“Dancing is not conducive to a proper learning environment.” The instructor asserts. He lets Aang march in place instead. They carry on, and Aang marches in his seat like he was given permission to, but somehow he can’t find it in himself to keep blowing the tsungi horn.</p><p>Though he doesn’t agree with it, he could understand the intention behind the Air Nomad genocide. It was to obliterate all obstacles that prevented the Fire Nation attack and reign. But what then, was the point of their overrule if they destroyed all the cultures of the Fire Nation too? What kind of empire did Sozin plan to lead if all of his people were fed lies and lived off of obedience? Aang couldn’t understand. </p><p>What he could understand was that another culture was dying. And he couldn’t just sit back and watch.</p><p>He came to the conclusion as he, Sokka and Katara returned to their little cave. “I’m going to  throw them a secret dance party.”</p><p>“Go to your room,” is the first thing Sokka can come up with. He gets a laugh in return. It’s obvious the airbender isn’t going to heed his warnings, but Sokka tries anyway. “Aang, are you really going to risk being found out for a dumb dance party?”</p><p>Except Aang’s no longer laughing. His gray eyes have steeled over when he replies. “It may be just dancing to you, Sokka. But it’s a tradition with historical importance to me. It’s a cultural heritage that I can’t just let die out here. Not again, when I can help prevent it.”</p><p>Those words alone are what get all three of them onboard with his idea. Though the party was found out in the end, Aang regards it as a complete success.</p><p>It starts off a bit awkward, no doubt, the majority of them timid. Aang can’t even blame them when he knows they’ve never witnessed this kind of dancing, maybe even any kind of dancing, in their entire lives. Luckily On Ji and a few others quickly warm up to the occasion, which then makes it easier for even more of Aang’s peers to join as well. Aang himself has the time of his life having the chance to do a little waterbending dancing with Katara. He is surprised that she trusts him to lead her wholeheartedly. For a moment all the other kids just stare as they make their way along the makeshift dance floor. Both Aang’s cheeks and ears blush as he thinks about their intimate little moment. Even so, the occasion itself is what makes him the happiest. And if he were honest with himself, it’s the happiest he’s been since he woke up after being struck by Azula. He isn’t sure why that is.</p><p>Aang looks down at the clouds as they fly past, the cave having been out of their peripheral view for sometime now. He thinks about why that event made him so happy, and comes up blank.</p><p>X</p><p>Later, when they’ve landed and finished setting up camp, Aang lay on the ground staring up at the stars. He sprawls his arms and legs out, just feeling the earth beneath him. It brings him an unexplainable comfort that the earth still crumbles in his palms the same way it did before he set out into that storm, all those years ago. </p><p>“Can’t sleep?” Katara whispers. She’s lying on her side with a palm to her cheek, her hair loose of all its ties. Behind her, Toph and Sokka lay sound asleep.</p><p>It’s a simple question, but somehow it compels Aang to reveal all of his innermost thoughts. They spill over one by one before he can put a stop to them.</p><p>“I just.. These past two days really opened my eyes. It made me realize that the war didn’t just take away from all the other nations, but from the Fire Nation too.” He turns to her, watching as the shadows of the campfire catch on her face, then turns back to the sky. “Seeing all of those kids dance with me tonight. I helped them relearn one aspect of their culture that the war wiped out. It just feels so.. Fulfilling. To know that I restored something. Even if it wasn’t something for my people. It gives me this new surge of hope, Katara, the fact that I managed to restore something lost to the war.” He turns to Katara. There she lies, just an arm away from him. “And you helped me.”</p><p>“I&rsquo;m glad that you got to experience that, Aang. I think it healed a part of you that you didn’t know was wounded.” He sees the stars reflect in her eyes as she continues to speak, and hangs onto every syllable. “That hope you feel right now? That’s how I felt the day Sokka and I found you in the iceberg.” She pauses before she says her next words. “And I feel it grow exponentially every time you take on your role as the Avatar.”</p><p>She tucks her hair behind her ears and continues. “I hope you understand now that you’re capable, Aang, of ending the war and restoring balance. You were always capable. But now more than ever.” </p><p>All the words in the universe evade him. He can’t even begin to explain all the emotions filled in the space of his chest. All these intense feelings he never even knew he was capable of feeling before tonight. One word and they’ll all come spilling out. His vision blurs as he tries to make sense of them all, but Katara remains smiling at him. </p><p>Aang closes his eyes and lies on his back again, swallowing in his tears and taking a moment to gather himself. He understands now, why her words bring so much comfort yet evoke the same amount of pain, too. Because saving it all means risking it all. And Aang, one way or another, is risking the Air Nomads by fighting this war. He&rsquo;d never spoken of this worry for fear that voicing it out would bring it closer to coming true. It was eating away at him the same way it was hurting him. But she’s just given him the realization that they have a chance. A fighting chance.</p><p>It takes all of him to gather enough courage to ask the next question.</p><p>“Katara?” He questions with as steady a voice he can manage.</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>Aang holds his breath. When he speaks, the words come out garbled and rushed. “When the war is over, do you think there’s a chance to revive the Air Nomads and their culture?”</p><p><i>My people and my culture. Do we have a chance?</i></p><p>She answers him in a heartbeat. “With you around, definitely.”</p><p>Somehow the weight of those two simple words are all it takes to break the dam. His tears betray him and he lets them, neither ashamed or uneasy. We have a chance, his mind chants over and over. One day, he will watch others inherit the culture of him and his people, not die out. He lets the weight of the unsettlement float away and cries, because this is the last time he’ll ever let it consume him the way it did. </p><p>He thinks about the remains of the Southern Air Temple, of the Fire Nation’s buried cultures, of the crisp smoke emanating from the buildings of Omashu the last time he’d seen them, of how he’d flown out Katara with him and consequently robbed the Southern Water Tribe of their last waterbender. They all have a chance. Aang will give them that chance.</p><p>He feels a hand squeeze his shoulder and turns. Katara lies beside him, still smiling.</p><p>Neither of them break the silence after that.</p>","body_abstract":"\n<p><b>For Kataang Week 2020</b>.<br></p>\n<p><b>Day 5: </b>Heritage/Responsibilities</p>\n<p><b>Words: </b>&nbsp;2,336 words</p>\n<p><b>Summary: </b>Aang restores one aspect of culture lost to the hundred year war.<b><br></b></p>\n<p><b>Author&rsquo;s note:&nbsp;\n\n</b>I went away for a few days so I&rsquo;m behind on Kataang week D: I know there&rsquo;s no obligation to do all prompts (much less do each on the day of like I&rsquo;ve been doing)..

Though the party was found out in the end, Aang regards it as a complete success.</p><p>It starts off a bit awkward, no doubt, the majority of them timid. Aang can’t even blame them when he knows they’ve never witnessed this kind of dancing, maybe even any kind of dancing, in their entire lives. Luckily On Ji and a few others quickly warm up to the occasion, which then makes it easier for even more of Aang’s peers to join as well. Aang himself has the time of his life having the chance to do a little waterbending dancing with Katara. He is surprised that she trusts him to lead her wholeheartedly. For a moment all the other kids just stare as they make their way along the makeshift dance floor. Both Aang’s cheeks and ears blush as he thinks about their intimate little moment. Even so, the occasion itself is what makes him the happiest. And if he were honest with himself, it’s the happiest he’s been since he woke up after being struck by Azula. He isn’t sure why that is.</p><p>Aang looks down at the clouds as they fly past, the cave having been out of their peripheral view for sometime now. He thinks about why that event made him so happy, and comes up blank.</p><p>X</p><p>Later, when they’ve landed and finished setting up camp, Aang lay on the ground staring up at the stars. He sprawls his arms and legs out, just feeling the earth beneath him. It brings him an unexplainable comfort that the earth still crumbles in his palms the same way it did before he set out into that storm, all those years ago. </p><p>“Can’t sleep?” Katara whispers. She’s lying on her side with a palm to her cheek, her hair loose of all its ties. Behind her, Toph and Sokka lay sound asleep.</p><p>It’s a simple question, but somehow it compels Aang to reveal all of his innermost thoughts. They spill over one by one before he can put a stop to them.</p><p>“I just.. These past two days really opened my eyes. It made me realize that the war didn’t just take away from all the other nations, but from the Fire Nation too.” He turns to her, watching as the shadows of the campfire catch on her face, then turns back to the sky. “Seeing all of those kids dance with me tonight. I helped them relearn one aspect of their culture that the war wiped out. It just feels so.. Fulfilling. To know that I restored something. Even if it wasn’t something for my people. It gives me this new surge of hope, Katara, the fact that I managed to restore something lost to the war.” He turns to Katara. There she lies, just an arm away from him. “And you helped me.”</p><p>“I’m glad that you got to experience that, Aang. I think it healed a part of you that you didn’t know was wounded.” He sees the stars reflect in her eyes as she continues to speak, and hangs onto every syllable. “That hope you feel right now? That’s how I felt the day Sokka and I found you in the iceberg.” She pauses before she says her next words. “And I feel it grow exponentially every time you take on your role as the Avatar.”</p><p>She tucks her hair behind her ears and continues. “I hope you understand now that you’re capable, Aang, of ending the war and restoring balance. You were always capable. But now more than ever.” </p><p>All the words in the universe evade him. He can’t even begin to explain all the emotions filled in the space of his chest. All these intense feelings he never even knew he was capable of feeling before tonight. One word and they’ll all come spilling out. His vision blurs as he tries to make sense of them all, but Katara remains smiling at him. </p><p>Aang closes his eyes and lies on his back again, swallowing in his tears and taking a moment to gather himself. He understands now, why her words bring so much comfort yet evoke the same amount of pain, too. Because saving it all means risking it all. And Aang, one way or another, is risking the Air Nomads by fighting this war. He’d never spoken of this worry for fear that voicing it out would bring it closer to coming true. It was eating away at him the same way it was hurting him. But she’s just given him the realization that they have a chance. A fighting chance.</p><p>It takes all of him to gather enough courage to ask the next question.</p><p>“Katara?” He questions with as steady a voice he can manage.</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>Aang holds his breath. When he speaks, the words come out garbled and rushed. “When the war is over, do you think there’s a chance to revive the Air Nomads and their culture?”</p><p><i>My people and my culture. Do we have a chance?</i></p><p>She answers him in a heartbeat. “With you around, definitely.”</p><p>Somehow the weight of those two simple words are all it takes to break the dam. His tears betray him and he lets them, neither ashamed or uneasy. We have a chance, his mind chants over and over. One day, he will watch others inherit the culture of him and his people, not die out. He lets the weight of the unsettlement float away and cries, because this is the last time he’ll ever let it consume him the way it did. </p><p>He thinks about the remains of the Southern Air Temple, of the Fire Nation’s buried cultures, of the crisp smoke emanating from the buildings of Omashu the last time he’d seen them, of how he’d flown out Katara with him and consequently robbed the Southern Water Tribe of their last waterbender. They all have a chance. Aang will give them that chance.</p><p>He feels a hand squeeze his shoulder and turns. Katara lies beside him, still smiling.</p><p>Neither of them break the silence after that.</p>","tree_html":""},"trail":[{"blog":{"name":"kyu-gsoo","active":true,"theme":{"header_full_width":1080,"header_full_height":1920,"header_focus_width":1080,"header_focus_height":607,"avatar_shape":"circle","background_color":"#FAFAFA","body_font":"Helvetica Neue","header_bounds":"656,1080,1263,0","header_image":"https://64.media.tumblr.com/770074e8d80bc4d21312e8988a648a73/9ddc0d83fb67fb8e-16/s1080x1920/3c57856b88cd307911906d8b09995fa1311c5513.jpg","header_image_focused":"https://64.media.tumblr.com/770074e8d80bc4d21312e8988a648a73/9ddc0d83fb67fb8e-16/s2048x3072_c0,34167,100000,65781/4913a963efeaa19e900c458893ad5a30eef6e140.jpg","header_image_poster":"","header_image_scaled":"https://64.media.tumblr.com/770074e8d80bc4d21312e8988a648a73/9ddc0d83fb67fb8e-16/s2048x3072/1d3f84d3ad5ffd498cc6103049d3c0b4b088a90d.jpg","header_stretch":true,"link_color":"#529ECC","show_avatar":true,"show_description":true,"show_header_image":true,"show_title":true,"title_color":"#000000","title_font":"Gibson","title_font_weight":"bold"},"share_likes":false,"share_following":false,"can_be_followed":true},"post":{"id":"625371001652445184"},"content_raw":"<p><b>For Kataang Week 2020</b>.<br></p><p><b>Day 5: </b>Heritage/Responsibilities</p><p><b>Words: </b> 2,336 words</p><p><b>Summary: </b>Aang restores one aspect of culture lost to the hundred year war.<b><br></b></p><p><b>Author’s note: \n\n</b>I went away for a few days so I’m behind on Kataang week D: I know there’s no obligation to do all prompts (much less do each on the day of like I’ve been doing)..

He thinks about the saddle the sandbenders had thrown out when they traded Appa, about the map he packed when he ran away that fateful day; scribbled with all the places he planned to visit, about the clothes he was wearing when Azula struck him; now left tattered and torn. The anguish that he feels watching the last physical item that tied him to his old life is red hot and all-consuming, just like the flames before him. </p><p>“That’s okay,” He’d said, even when it was not. “It would give away my identity.” He tried not to think about how he was the only piece of the Air Nomads and their culture left in existence. A living relic. Aang’s identity as an airbender was the only thing he had yet to sacrifice, and he wasn’t planning on doing so anytime soon.</p><p>Which is why, when he puts on the headband for the first time, it hurts him more than he can put into words. He realizes as he closes the cloth around his forehead that there isn’t anywhere he can check for his reflection, and is grateful for the small mercy. He can’t even begin to imagine what he would look like without his tattoos.</p><p>This war, he thinks to himself. It just keeps taking and taking and taking. Aang is sure by now, as he hides his tattoos, that he no longer has any more left to give. </p><p>Still, he shakes the thoughts away and plasters on his signature lopsided smile. “Tada! Normal kid.”</p><p>He watches Toph and Sokka squabble over the earthbender’s new Fire Nation style shoes. In this instance, as she and Sokka bicker about, Aang finds that from an outsider’s perspective, they really do look like nothing but normal kids. Just a bunch of friends hanging out close to the shoreline. The minor moments of normalcy they are afforded are few and far in between, so Aang lets himself laugh wholeheartedly because he doesn’t know when he will next find this type of joy.</p><p>Katara’s voice breaks him out of his laughter. “How do I look?” She stands from head to toe in red, a nice contrast to her dark skin.</p><p>Beautiful is his first thought, because she is. The thought that follows is, “Uhh, your mom’s necklace.”</p><p>The waterbender immediately reaches up to touch the pendant at her neck. “Oh,” is all she says at first, obviously reluctant. Aang watches her unclasp and remove it anyway. “Oh yeah. I guess it’s pretty obviously Water Tribe, isn’t it?” Katara’s fist closes around the small choker, concealing the last of her true identity. Here and now, she follows the rest of them and gives into the guise of a Fire Nation citizen.</p><p>The disappointment her face mars is a painful reminder that they are all sacrificing bits of themselves for this war. That, consequently, they can all find solace in one another. Aang wonders briefly if that is a blessing or a curse.</p><p>Again he pushes this thought away. Instead, he follows his companions as they begin their trek into town.</p><p>X</p><p>It’s a slow day in town. Granted, he couldn’t really think much of it, since he and Momo somehow got roped into attending a local elementary school. The first day isn’t so bad, though Aang doesn’t remember this many customs present all those times he visited Kuzon. It takes him one too many times to get the bow right that he worries he’ll blow his cover soon. He has one of his new classmates to thank for hinting at him the proper way. Later, he learns that her name is On Ji. </p><p>Of course, when he returns to their hideout, he gets an earful from Sokka for wandering off. That doesn’t stop him from attending the next day.</p><p>But the second day is what really tests his limits. </p><p>Of all the ways to start the day, Aang never imagined staring at a portrait of the former Fire Lord Sozin being one of them. He follows the suit of the other students and stands rigidly, mouthing incorrectly to all the words of an oath he knows nothing about. The teacher catches on and is quick to punish him and his classmates with a pop quiz. This puzzles Aang even more. As if having to pledge allegiance to the very man who started the war wasn’t weird enough, the teacher adds insults to injury by starting off their quiz with:</p><p>“What year did Firelord Sozin battle the Air Nation army?”</p><p>He raises his hand almost immediately. The teacher, clearly irritated, indulges him anyway. “Is that a trick question? The Air Nomads didn’t have a formal military. Sozin defeated them by ambush.” He tries not to make it sound so defensive, instead feigning confusion. Almost all of his peers stare dumbfounded at him, but he waits for the teacher’s response anyway. These are his people they were talking about. How could they fabricate history books so blatantly? Was wiping them off the face of the earth not cruel enough?</p><p>“Well, I don’t know how you could possibly know more than our national history book, unless you were there a hundred years ago.” She clips and raises an eyebrow, as if challenging him to defy her.</p><p>The young airbender’s nervous laughter rings throughout the classroom. He wants so badly to question her further, to probe how exactly an Air Nomad <i>militia</i> came about, when it was within their ways to avoid violence at all costs. They were carefree, spontaneous, and had a spiritual weightlessness to them. But these words die on his tongue, all for the sake of keeping his identity secret. It pains him that he has no choice but to accept these lies knowing they are untrue. Though he owes it to his people to set things straight, he sits down and lets the culture of the Air Nomads once again get lost in translation. </p><p>X </p><p>It is during Music Class that he finally snaps.</p><p>He was just dancing. But the teacher had called it a “nervous disorder.”</p><p>“Dancing is not conducive to a proper learning environment.” The instructor asserts. He lets Aang march in place instead. They carry on, and Aang marches in his seat like he was given permission to, but somehow he can’t find it in himself to keep blowing the tsungi horn.</p><p>Though he doesn’t agree with it, he could understand the intention behind the Air Nomad genocide. It was to obliterate all obstacles that prevented the Fire Nation attack and reign. But what then, was the point of their overrule if they destroyed all the cultures of the Fire Nation too? What kind of empire did Sozin plan to lead if all of his people were fed lies and lived off of obedience? Aang couldn’t understand. </p><p>What he could understand was that another culture was dying. And he couldn’t just sit back and watch.</p><p>He came to the conclusion as he, Sokka and Katara returned to their little cave. “I’m going to  throw them a secret dance party.”</p><p>“Go to your room,” is the first thing Sokka can come up with. He gets a laugh in return. It’s obvious the airbender isn’t going to heed his warnings, but Sokka tries anyway. “Aang, are you really going to risk being found out for a dumb dance party?”</p><p>Except Aang’s no longer laughing. His gray eyes have steeled over when he replies. “It may be just dancing to you, Sokka. But it’s a tradition with historical importance to me. It’s a cultural heritage that I can’t just let die out here. Not again, when I can help prevent it.”</p><p>Those words alone are what get all three of them onboard with his idea.

He sprawls his arms and legs out, just feeling the earth beneath him. It brings him an unexplainable comfort that the earth still crumbles in his palms the same way it did before he set out into that storm, all those years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t sleep?&rdquo; Katara whispers. She&rsquo;s lying on her side with a palm to her cheek, her hair loose of all its ties. Behind her, Toph and Sokka lay sound asleep.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a simple question, but somehow it compels Aang to reveal all of his innermost thoughts. They spill over one by one before he can put a stop to them.</p><p>&ldquo;I just.. These past two days really opened my eyes. It made me realize that the war didn&rsquo;t just take away from all the other nations, but from the Fire Nation too.&rdquo; He turns to her, watching as the shadows of the campfire catch on her face, then turns back to the sky. &ldquo;Seeing all of those kids dance with me tonight. I helped them relearn one aspect of their culture that the war wiped out. It just feels so.. Fulfilling. To know that I restored something. Even if it wasn&rsquo;t something for my people. It gives me this new surge of hope, Katara, the fact that I managed to restore something lost to the war.&rdquo; He turns to Katara. There she lies, just an arm away from him. &ldquo;And you helped me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad that you got to experience that, Aang. I think it healed a part of you that you didn&rsquo;t know was wounded.&rdquo; He sees the stars reflect in her eyes as she continues to speak, and hangs onto every syllable. &ldquo;That hope you feel right now? That&rsquo;s how I felt the day Sokka and I found you in the iceberg.&rdquo; She pauses before she says her next words. &ldquo;And I feel it grow exponentially every time you take on your role as the Avatar.&rdquo;</p><p>She tucks her hair behind her ears and continues. &ldquo;I hope you understand now that you&rsquo;re capable, Aang, of ending the war and restoring balance. You were always capable. But now more than ever.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>All the words in the universe evade him. He can&rsquo;t even begin to explain all the emotions filled in the space of his chest. All these intense feelings he never even knew he was capable of feeling before tonight. One word and they&rsquo;ll all come spilling out. His vision blurs as he tries to make sense of them all, but Katara remains smiling at him.&nbsp;</p><p>Aang closes his eyes and lies on his back again, swallowing in his tears and taking a moment to gather himself. He understands now, why her words bring so much comfort yet evoke the same amount of pain, too. Because saving it all means risking it all. And Aang, one way or another, is risking the Air Nomads by fighting this war. He&rsquo;d never spoken of this worry for fear that voicing it out would bring it closer to coming true. It was eating away at him the same way it was hurting him. But she&rsquo;s just given him the realization that they have a chance. A fighting chance.</p><p>It takes all of him to gather enough courage to ask the next question.</p><p>&ldquo;Katara?&rdquo; He questions with as steady a voice he can manage.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>Aang holds his breath. When he speaks, the words come out garbled and rushed. &ldquo;When the war is over, do you think there&rsquo;s a chance to revive the Air Nomads and their culture?&rdquo;</p><p><i>My people and my culture. Do we have a chance?</i></p><p>She answers him in a heartbeat. &ldquo;With you around, definitely.&rdquo;</p><p>Somehow the weight of those two simple words are all it takes to break the dam. His tears betray him and he lets them, neither ashamed or uneasy. We have a chance, his mind chants over and over. One day, he will watch others inherit the culture of him and his people, not die out. He lets the weight of the unsettlement float away and cries, because this is the last time he&rsquo;ll ever let it consume him the way it did.&nbsp;</p><p>He thinks about the remains of the Southern Air Temple, of the Fire Nation&rsquo;s buried cultures, of the crisp smoke emanating from the buildings of Omashu the last time he&rsquo;d seen them, of how he&rsquo;d flown out Katara with him and consequently robbed the Southern Water Tribe of their last waterbender. They all have a chance. Aang will give them that chance.</p><p>He feels a hand squeeze his shoulder and turns. Katara lies beside him, still smiling.</p><p>Neither of them break the silence after that.</p>","content_abstract":"<p>\n<p><b>For Kataang Week 2020</b>.<br /></p>\n<p><b>Day 5: </b>Heritage/Responsibilities</p>\n<p><b>Words: </b>&nbsp;2,336 words</p>\n<p><b>Summary: </b>Aang restores one aspect of culture lost to the hundred year war.<b><br /></b></p>\n<p><b>Author&rsquo;s note:&nbsp;\n\n</b>I went away for a few days so I&rsquo;m behind on Kataang week D: I know there&rsquo;s no obligation to do all prompts (much less do each on the day of like I&rsquo;ve been doing)..

Just playing in someone     else’s sandbox.</i></p><p>Carefully the girl copies the last information she needs from the fragile scroll. Rising from the long table tucked into a secluded nook of the Ba Sing Se University Library, she deftly rolls the manuscript as she quickly crosses the quiet room. With a slight bow she returns the document to the elderly librarian sitting behind an imposingly ornate stone desk.</p><p>“Not many people have an interest in this subject matter any more,” the  man comments, clearly bursting with curiosity as to why the young woman desires such obscure and antiquated volumes. Even in forward-thinking Ba Sing Se scholars of esoteric knowledge aren&rsquo;t often female.</p><p>The girl merely murmurs a noncommittal syllable that could be interpreted as agreement if one were feeling agreeable, or as disagreement if one weren&rsquo;t so inclined. With a second bow she turns and walks away.</p><p>Li Bao holds the returned scroll loosely in a hand that is age-spotted but still strong and well-manicured.  He watches the mysterious figure depart. Though his interests don&rsquo;t tend in that direction and wouldn&rsquo;t even if he were a half century younger, the girl is undeniably lovely. Large eyes of an unusual blue contrast sharply with her dark complexion. She is tall, slim, and graceful. And completely inscrutable. Every few weeks she shows up and reads for hours, inevitably requesting books and scrolls that have lain untouched for decades. She speaks only when she wishes to request another tome and ignores the male appreciation she attracts from undergrads (and not a few faculty members).</p><p>Careful observation of library visitors over many years has made Bao an astute judge. He knows deep in his gut which patrons are likely to excise information they find objectionable, which will giggle over illustrated lovemaking manuals, and which smuggle in forbidden foodstuffs that will leave blots and crumbs. He makes a game of guessing into which category each new visitor falls as he encounters them. And, of course, he intervenes when necessary.  </p><p>Yet he can never decide where this girl fits. Her schedule is too erratic for a serious student, yet she has the manner of one. When approached by boys and men wishing to become better acquainted, she responds with icy silence. Yet he&rsquo;s seen her silently weeping over some of the volumes he retrieves for her. Other times her eyes clearly communicate a rage so deep it stops his breath. She&rsquo;s not as coldly indifferent as she often appears. These emotional responses seem at odds with her scholarly mien.</p><p>The girl&rsquo;s  apathy over the copious male attention she receives first led Bao to guess that her interests also lay in her own sex or perhaps in none at all, but then he encountered her on the street in the Upper Ring with a young man.</p><p>Her cool demeanor was nowhere to be seen as she beamed and laughed up at him, cheeks rosy with joy and attraction, her hand entwined with her lover&rsquo;s. She pulled the boy into a recessed doorway and kissed him like she couldn&rsquo;t survive another moment without his touch. Despite his age and experience, Bao blushed at such naked longing. Though he couldn&rsquo;t see much of the boy because of a large-brimmed hat covering his hair and shading his eyes, every line of the young man&rsquo;s body declared his ardent return of the girl&rsquo;s interest. Bao had smiled widely, pleased that the too-grave-for-her-age young woman was not always serious or sad.</p><p>Bao&rsquo;s musing is interrupted by the adjust professor of bending theory, Chan Meili, as she slides a material request across the desk under his nose. Rather than immediately engaging Bao in rueful speculation over the library&rsquo;s other patrons as is her wont, Meili also stares after the departing figure of the girl.</p><p>“Wow,” Meili sighs, “I&rsquo;ve never seen Master Katara up close before. Does she come here often?”</p><p>Bao starts. “Master Katara? She&rsquo;s a bending master? At that age?&rsquo;</p><p>Meili is shocked. “Please don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;ve never heard of Master Katara!”</p><p>“Til this moment I didn&rsquo;t even know her name.”</p><p>Meili chuckles, “You need to get out more, Bao! Master Katara helped save the world by defeating that crazy Fire Nation princess.  And she&rsquo;s the Avatar&rsquo;s girlfriend.” Meili drops her voice to a suggestive whisper, “They&rsquo;re said to be quite disgustingly in love.”</p><p>Oh. <i>Oh!</i></p><p>Suddenly the puzzle pieces constituting the girl slide into place. He feels a bit like crying himself as he realizes the reason for her intense reactions to reading about the long-gone Air Nomads.</p><p>• • • •</p><p>Katara hurries out of the library, tucking her notes into a large satchel slung over her shoulder. Glee suffuses her being as she finally drops her serious student facade and nearly dances along the street, plans percolating in her brain.</p><p>Three brief shopping stops later she&rsquo;s headed back to the Upper-Ring house that King Kuei formally gifted to Aang two years ago when Aang reached legal adulthood according to the customs of the Earth Kingdom. Katara made it her official residence after she accepted the lead healer position at the Ba Sing Se Healing Center shortly thereafter. Toph, Sokka, and Suki all maintain rooms in the house for their frequent visits to the city. Though Zuko and Mai often visit as well, political expedience keeps them closer to the palace when they stay in Ba Sing Se.</p><p>But today the house would only hold Aang and her. And she has big plans for the night to come.</p><p>Katara stashes her satchel under her writing desk after removing a few of her pages of notes and sketches. From a lower drawer she pulls a basket containing skeins of silk thread, beads, and a tiny steel hook. Looking down at her sketches, she carefully uses the hook to draw together silk strands into small loops that she then works into a complicated pattern. Occasionally she threads a tiny bead onto the tip of the hook and works it into the arrangement. Half an hour later she finishes. Her project is complete,threads snipped and loose ends sewn down. Katara tucks it into her pocket with a grin and stows her supplies back in the drawer.</p><p>Katara carries the notes and sketches into the kitchen. Checking the time-keeping candle, she notes that it&rsquo;s just past 3 o'candle. Before Aang left that  morning he  promised to return by 6 o'candle. She has never attempted any of the dishes planned for tonight, so she figures it&rsquo;s best to get started cooking.</p><p>• • • •</p><p>Aang is immediately surrounded by delicious aromas when he opens the front door of his house. Wonderingly, he stops in the doorway. Memories from his childhood fill his mind.</p><p>Gyatso ladles soup into his bowl. A crowd of air nomads enjoys a picnic on a grassy plain, kites blazing brilliant color above. Novitiates race through a courtyard on air scooters. Scores of air bison circle above his head. All with the same background scents he now experiences.</p><p>Katara hears Aang come in, but then there&rsquo;s silence. Confused, she heads toward the door. Aang is standing just inside, one hand still resting on the knob. He looks transfixed but his gaze is unfocused.</p><p>“Sweetie?” Katara asks.</p><p>With a small shake of his head, Aang smiles and pulls Katara into his arms. He drops a kiss onto the tip of her nose. Katara winds her arms around his shoulders and presses her lips to the edge of his jaw. Aang hums contentedly. They press together more closely and rest quietly in the embrace for a moment</p><p>Aang breaks the silence “It smells wonderful in here!” he enthuses, “no sea prunes tonight?”</p><p>Katara slaps his shoulder lightly and laughs. “No sea prunes. Why don&rsquo;t you wash up and then you can see what we do have.”</p><p>While Aang washes away the concerns of a day spent coaxing recalcitrant politicians into listening to each other, Katara arranges the food she prepared on their low table. She sits on a floor cushion and waits apprehensively, twisting her fingers together until she notices she&rsquo;s doing so. She grips the edge of the table instead, nerves rising.</p><p>Aang stands in the doorway behind Katara, a stunned look on his face.  </p><p>“Katara, you made all this?” he whispers.</p><p>Katara starts at his words, then babbles nervously. “Oh, you&rsquo;re here! Of course you&rsquo;re here. I just didn&rsquo;t hear you come in. Because you were behind me, obviously. And you&rsquo;re really light on your feet, you know. Toph may be onto something, calling you Twinkletoes. Do you think&ndash;”</p><p>Aang curtails the babbling by lifting her to her feet and pressing his lips to hers. His arms wind around her waist. Katara leans into him, one hand rising to his face, caressing his cheek as the kiss deepens. Abruptly, she pulls her face away, breathing with evident difficulty. He leans his forehead against hers, also breathing heavily.</p><p>“Aang! Stop! If you keep kissing me, we may not eat until everything is as cold as the laping.”</p><p>“I can&rsquo;t believe you made laping! And butter tea and cabbage momos and sepen! All my childhood favorites. Everything looks and smells like I remember. How did you do this?” Aang asks with a wondering shake of his head.</p><p>Katara grins at him. “Did you know that Ba Sing Se University has the largest collection of scrolls and books about Air Nomads outside of Wan Shih Tong&rsquo;s library? Their undergraduate library is open to the public and I&rsquo;ve been visiting for the past year, trying to learn more about your culture.”</p><p>“But why, Katara? Are you still” Aang pauses as he considers the most politic way to express his thoughts, “&hellip;um&hellip;worried about my relationship with the Air Acolytes? Please don&rsquo;t be. There is no one I love and admire more than you. You don&rsquo;t need to know or be anything else. You impress me all on your own, sifu Katara.”</p><p>Katara blushes, slightly, as ever a bit undone when he addresses her so.</p><p>“No, it&rsquo;s not about the Air Acolytes at all. Or maybe they inspired me some.” She hesitates, unsure how to convey all her reasons. “You&rsquo;re the best person I know, so honorable and brave and kind. I wanted to know more about how you became you. I needed to know your people. To know mine, you can visit Gran Gran and listen to her stories. You can sit in her home and eat her food. I can&rsquo;t talk to Gyatso or break bread with him, so I&rsquo;ve been reading everything I can to learn and understand.”</p><p>She gazes steadily into his eyes and reveals her deepest reason “And I wanted to make you happy. I know you love being an Air Nomad, love your people and traditions and food and history. So I tried to give you a bit more of your culture, here in our home.”</p><p>The words &lsquo;our home&rsquo; bring wide smiles to both their faces. After all they&rsquo;ve endured, sharing a home and a life delights them.</p><p>Aang steps back and motions her toward the table. </p><p>They seat themselves and once again Aang is overcome with what she has accomplished. “I don&rsquo;t know how to make any of these things, except butter tea. Are there actually scrolls at Ba Sing Se University that tell you how to make Air Nomad food?”</p><p>“There are, and much more, too. Of course, I didn&rsquo;t know exactly what everything is supposed to taste like, so it was hard to know which recipes to use. A lot of the time, I couldn&rsquo;t even tell which information in the scrolls was true and which was misunderstood or even completely wrong. Can you believe I found one manuscript that said it was common for an Air Nomad marriage to include a woman and several men?” Katara&rsquo;s expression is both scandalized and amused.</p><p>“Oh, that one is true.” Aang replies as he tastes a momo with some sepen.</p><p>Katara&rsquo;s mouth hangs open, “You&rsquo;re joking. Right? You are joking, aren&rsquo;t you?”</p><p>“No. Marriage is sacred. I would never joke about something sacred. Mmm, this is wonderful! The sepen adds the perfect amount of spice.”</p><p>Katara continues to stare, too shocked to speak.</p><p>Aang notices her consternation. “Not always one woman and several men, though. Sometimes one man and several women.”</p><p>At this, Katara&rsquo;s astonishment gathers a bit of ire. “I hope you realize that I am a two people in a relationship and that&rsquo;s it kind of girl!”</p><p>“Well, that was how things worked out in most instances&ndash;a man and a woman, or two women, or two men. But as long as there is love shared between everyone, what goes on inside a marriage is no matter of concern for anyone outside the union, right?”</p><p>Katara&rsquo;s lips tighten and Aang realizes that this line of talk is not endearing himself to his love. He decides that more eating and less talking will likely result in a much friendlier girlfriend and a warmer bed.</p><p>Aang&rsquo;s fervent appreciation of the meal thaws Katara&rsquo;s disapproval and their talk shifts to comparing culinary traditions as they continue the meal.</p><p>By the time they&rsquo;ve finished eating, both are smiling, once again in perfect amity. </p><p>As Aang begins to rise Katara realizes the time has come for her final objective. Wiping sweat from her palms onto her tunic, she scoots closer to Aang and reaches for his hands. Hers tremble slightly as she wraps her fingers around his.</p><p>She looks into his smiling gray eyes and suddenly everything feels a bit easier.</p><p>“Aang, I love you. I want to spend the rest of my life by your side. I want the whole world to know that you are mine and I am yours.” She reaches into her side pocket and pulls out the woven ring she crafted according to the drawings  she found in the library. “Will you marry me, Aang?” she asks as she holds the ring out to him.</p><p>This is right. This is how the next step must go. Aang has always been ahead of her, knowing his own heart before she knew hers and offering it up without reservation. Now she needs him to know that her love for him is just as deep and all-consuming as his for her, that she holds nothing back from him.</p><p>And now Aang&rsquo;s hands are the ones that tremble. He finds he cannot speak around some mysterious obstacle that has materialized in his throat. Lacking the power of speech, he takes the ring from her and places it on his left thumb. The left hand is closer to the heart, the seat of love. And the thumb is closer to the heart than the other digits, so that&rsquo;s where Air Nomads place the sign of their love. He knows without asking that she made the ring herself. Who but Katara would use all the colors of water accented with shining beads like chips of ice to make a betrothal ring for an airbender?</p><p>He realizes he has been staring at her ring on his finger for quite a while when she speaks.</p><p>“Aang? Aang, sweetie? You&rsquo;re making me worry a bit. Is that a yes?”</p><p>He rises and draws her to her feet as well. “Of course it&rsquo;s yes!”</p><p>Then she&rsquo;s being lifted off her feet and spun around the room to the sound of his laughter. She rests her head against his shoulder and silently promises to make him laugh every day for the rest of forever.</p><p><i>Author’s note: OMG&hellip;I can’t believe I did this.

Rising from the long table tucked into a secluded nook of the Ba Sing Se University Library, she deftly rolls the manuscript as she quickly crosses the quiet room. With a slight bow she returns the document to the elderly librarian sitting behind an imposingly ornate stone desk.</p><p>“Not many people have an interest in this subject matter any more,” the  man comments, clearly bursting with curiosity as to why the young woman desires such obscure and antiquated volumes. Even in forward-thinking Ba Sing Se scholars of esoteric knowledge aren’t often female.</p><p>The girl merely murmurs a noncommittal syllable that could be interpreted as agreement if one were feeling agreeable, or as disagreement if one weren’t so inclined. With a second bow she turns and walks away.</p><p>Li Bao holds the returned scroll loosely in a hand that is age-spotted but still strong and well-manicured.  He watches the mysterious figure depart. Though his interests don’t tend in that direction and wouldn’t even if he were a half century younger, the girl is undeniably lovely. Large eyes of an unusual blue contrast sharply with her dark complexion. She is tall, slim, and graceful. And completely inscrutable. Every few weeks she shows up and reads for hours, inevitably requesting books and scrolls that have lain untouched for decades. She speaks only when she wishes to request another tome and ignores the male appreciation she attracts from undergrads (and not a few faculty members).</p><p>Careful observation of library visitors over many years has made Bao an astute judge. He knows deep in his gut which patrons are likely to excise information they find objectionable, which will giggle over illustrated lovemaking manuals, and which smuggle in forbidden foodstuffs that will leave blots and crumbs. He makes a game of guessing into which category each new visitor falls as he encounters them. And, of course, he intervenes when necessary.  </p><p>Yet he can never decide where this girl fits. Her schedule is too erratic for a serious student, yet she has the manner of one. When approached by boys and men wishing to become better acquainted, she responds with icy silence. Yet he’s seen her silently weeping over some of the volumes he retrieves for her. Other times her eyes clearly communicate a rage so deep it stops his breath. She’s not as coldly indifferent as she often appears. These emotional responses seem at odds with her scholarly mien.</p><p>The girl’s  apathy over the copious male attention she receives first led Bao to guess that her interests also lay in her own sex or perhaps in none at all, but then he encountered her on the street in the Upper Ring with a young man.</p><p>Her cool demeanor was nowhere to be seen as she beamed and laughed up at him, cheeks rosy with joy and attraction, her hand entwined with her lover’s. She pulled the boy into a recessed doorway and kissed him like she couldn’t survive another moment without his touch. Despite his age and experience, Bao blushed at such naked longing. Though he couldn’t see much of the boy because of a large-brimmed hat covering his hair and shading his eyes, every line of the young man’s body declared his ardent return of the girl’s interest. Bao had smiled widely, pleased that the too-grave-for-her-age young woman was not always serious or sad.</p><p>Bao’s musing is interrupted by the adjust professor of bending theory, Chan Meili, as she slides a material request across the desk under his nose. Rather than immediately engaging Bao in rueful speculation over the library’s other patrons as is her wont, Meili also stares after the departing figure of the girl.</p><p>“Wow,” Meili sighs, “I’ve never seen Master Katara up close before. Does she come here often?”</p><p>Bao starts. “Master Katara? She’s a bending master? At that age?’</p><p>Meili is shocked. “Please don’t tell me you’ve never heard of Master Katara!”</p><p>“Til this moment I didn’t even know her name.”</p><p>Meili chuckles, “You need to get out more, Bao! Master Katara helped save the world by defeating that crazy Fire Nation princess.  And she’s the Avatar’s girlfriend.” Meili drops her voice to a suggestive whisper, “They’re said to be quite disgustingly in love.”</p><p>Oh. <i>Oh!</i></p><p>Suddenly the puzzle pieces constituting the girl slide into place. He feels a bit like crying himself as he realizes the reason for her intense reactions to reading about the long-gone Air Nomads.</p><p>• • • •</p><p>Katara hurries out of the library, tucking her notes into a large satchel slung over her shoulder. Glee suffuses her being as she finally drops her serious student facade and nearly dances along the street, plans percolating in her brain.</p><p>Three brief shopping stops later she’s headed back to the Upper-Ring house that King Kuei formally gifted to Aang two years ago when Aang reached legal adulthood according to the customs of the Earth Kingdom. Katara made it her official residence after she accepted the lead healer position at the Ba Sing Se Healing Center shortly thereafter. Toph, Sokka, and Suki all maintain rooms in the house for their frequent visits to the city. Though Zuko and Mai often visit as well, political expedience keeps them closer to the palace when they stay in Ba Sing Se.</p><p>But today the house would only hold Aang and her. And she has big plans for the night to come.</p><p>Katara stashes her satchel under her writing desk after removing a few of her pages of notes and sketches. From a lower drawer she pulls a basket containing skeins of silk thread, beads, and a tiny steel hook. Looking down at her sketches, she carefully uses the hook to draw together silk strands into small loops that she then works into a complicated pattern. Occasionally she threads a tiny bead onto the tip of the hook and works it into the arrangement. Half an hour later she finishes. Her project is complete,threads snipped and loose ends sewn down. Katara tucks it into her pocket with a grin and stows her supplies back in the drawer.</p><p>Katara carries the notes and sketches into the kitchen. Checking the time-keeping candle, she notes that it’s just past 3 o'candle. Before Aang left that  morning he  promised to return by 6 o'candle. She has never attempted any of the dishes planned for tonight, so she figures it’s best to get started cooking.</p><p>• • • •</p><p>Aang is immediately surrounded by delicious aromas when he opens the front door of his house. Wonderingly, he stops in the doorway. Memories from his childhood fill his mind.</p><p>Gyatso ladles soup into his bowl. A crowd of air nomads enjoys a picnic on a grassy plain, kites blazing brilliant color above. Novitiates race through a courtyard on air scooters. Scores of air bison circle above his head. All with the same background scents he now experiences.</p><p>Katara hears Aang come in, but then there’s silence. Confused, she heads toward the door. Aang is standing just inside, one hand still resting on the knob. He looks transfixed but his gaze is unfocused.</p><p>“Sweetie?” Katara asks.</p><p>With a small shake of his head, Aang smiles and pulls Katara into his arms. He drops a kiss onto the tip of her nose. Katara winds her arms around his shoulders and presses her lips to the edge of his jaw. Aang hums contentedly. They press together more closely and rest quietly in the embrace for a moment</p><p>Aang breaks the silence “It smells wonderful in here!” he enthuses, “no sea prunes tonight?”</p><p>Katara slaps his shoulder lightly and laughs. “No sea prunes. Why don’t you wash up and then you can see what we do have.”</p><p>While Aang washes away the concerns of a day spent coaxing recalcitrant politicians into listening to each other, Katara arranges the food she prepared on their low table. She sits on a floor cushion and waits apprehensively, twisting her fingers together until she notices she’s doing so. She grips the edge of the table instead, nerves rising.</p><p>Aang stands in the doorway behind Katara, a stunned look on his face.  </p><p>“Katara, you made all this?” he whispers.</p><p>Katara starts at his words, then babbles nervously. “Oh, you’re here! Of course you’re here. I just didn’t hear you come in. Because you were behind me, obviously. And you’re really light on your feet, you know. Toph may be onto something, calling you Twinkletoes. Do you think–”</p><p>Aang curtails the babbling by lifting her to her feet and pressing his lips to hers. His arms wind around her waist. Katara leans into him, one hand rising to his face, caressing his cheek as the kiss deepens. Abruptly, she pulls her face away, breathing with evident difficulty. He leans his forehead against hers, also breathing heavily.</p><p>“Aang! Stop! If you keep kissing me, we may not eat until everything is as cold as the laping.”</p><p>“I can’t believe you made laping! And butter tea and cabbage momos and sepen! All my childhood favorites.

Katara leans into him, one hand rising to his face, caressing his cheek as the kiss deepens. Abruptly, she pulls her face away, breathing with evident difficulty. He leans his forehead against hers, also breathing heavily.</p><p>“Aang! Stop! If you keep kissing me, we may not eat until everything is as cold as the laping.”</p><p>“I can’t believe you made laping! And butter tea and cabbage momos and sepen! All my childhood favorites. Everything looks and smells like I remember. How did you do this?” Aang asks with a wondering shake of his head.</p><p>Katara grins at him. “Did you know that Ba Sing Se University has the largest collection of scrolls and books about Air Nomads outside of Wan Shih Tong’s library? Their undergraduate library is open to the public and I’ve been visiting for the past year, trying to learn more about your culture.”</p><p>“But why, Katara? Are you still” Aang pauses as he considers the most politic way to express his thoughts, “…um…worried about my relationship with the Air Acolytes? Please don’t be. There is no one I love and admire more than you. You don’t need to know or be anything else. You impress me all on your own, sifu Katara.”</p><p>Katara blushes, slightly, as ever a bit undone when he addresses her so.</p><p>“No, it’s not about the Air Acolytes at all. Or maybe they inspired me some.” She hesitates, unsure how to convey all her reasons. “You’re the best person I know, so honorable and brave and kind. I wanted to know more about how you became you. I needed to know your people. To know mine, you can visit Gran Gran and listen to her stories. You can sit in her home and eat her food. I can’t talk to Gyatso or break bread with him, so I’ve been reading everything I can to learn and understand.”</p><p>She gazes steadily into his eyes and reveals her deepest reason “And I wanted to make you happy. I know you love being an Air Nomad, love your people and traditions and food and history. So I tried to give you a bit more of your culture, here in our home.”</p><p>The words ‘our home’ bring wide smiles to both their faces. After all they’ve endured, sharing a home and a life delights them.</p><p>Aang steps back and motions her toward the table. </p><p>They seat themselves and once again Aang is overcome with what she has accomplished. “I don’t know how to make any of these things, except butter tea. Are there actually scrolls at Ba Sing Se University that tell you how to make Air Nomad food?”</p><p>“There are, and much more, too. Of course, I didn’t know exactly what everything is supposed to taste like, so it was hard to know which recipes to use. A lot of the time, I couldn’t even tell which information in the scrolls was true and which was misunderstood or even completely wrong. Can you believe I found one manuscript that said it was common for an Air Nomad marriage to include a woman and several men?” Katara’s expression is both scandalized and amused.</p><p>“Oh, that one is true.” Aang replies as he tastes a momo with some sepen.</p><p>Katara’s mouth hangs open, “You’re joking. Right? You are joking, aren’t you?”</p><p>“No. Marriage is sacred. I would never joke about something sacred. Mmm, this is wonderful! The sepen adds the perfect amount of spice.”</p><p>Katara continues to stare, too shocked to speak.</p><p>Aang notices her consternation. “Not always one woman and several men, though. Sometimes one man and several women.”</p><p>At this, Katara’s astonishment gathers a bit of ire. “I hope you realize that I am a two people in a relationship and that’s it kind of girl!”</p><p>“Well, that was how things worked out in most instances–a man and a woman, or two women, or two men. But as long as there is love shared between everyone, what goes on inside a marriage is no matter of concern for anyone outside the union, right?”</p><p>Katara’s lips tighten and Aang realizes that this line of talk is not endearing himself to his love. He decides that more eating and less talking will likely result in a much friendlier girlfriend and a warmer bed.</p><p>Aang’s fervent appreciation of the meal thaws Katara’s disapproval and their talk shifts to comparing culinary traditions as they continue the meal.</p><p>By the time they’ve finished eating, both are smiling, once again in perfect amity. </p><p>As Aang begins to rise Katara realizes the time has come for her final objective. Wiping sweat from her palms onto her tunic, she scoots closer to Aang and reaches for his hands. Hers tremble slightly as she wraps her fingers around his.</p><p>She looks into his smiling gray eyes and suddenly everything feels a bit easier.</p><p>“Aang, I love you. I want to spend the rest of my life by your side. I want the whole world to know that you are mine and I am yours.” She reaches into her side pocket and pulls out the woven ring she crafted according to the drawings  she found in the library. “Will you marry me, Aang?” she asks as she holds the ring out to him.</p><p>This is right. This is how the next step must go. Aang has always been ahead of her, knowing his own heart before she knew hers and offering it up without reservation. Now she needs him to know that her love for him is just as deep and all-consuming as his for her, that she holds nothing back from him.</p><p>And now Aang’s hands are the ones that tremble. He finds he cannot speak around some mysterious obstacle that has materialized in his throat. Lacking the power of speech, he takes the ring from her and places it on his left thumb. The left hand is closer to the heart, the seat of love. And the thumb is closer to the heart than the other digits, so that’s where Air Nomads place the sign of their love. He knows without asking that she made the ring herself. Who but Katara would use all the colors of water accented with shining beads like chips of ice to make a betrothal ring for an airbender?</p><p>He realizes he has been staring at her ring on his finger for quite a while when she speaks.</p><p>“Aang? Aang, sweetie? You’re making me worry a bit. Is that a yes?”</p><p>He rises and draws her to her feet as well. “Of course it’s yes!”</p><p>Then she’s being lifted off her feet and spun around the room to the sound of his laughter. She rests her head against his shoulder and silently promises to make him laugh every day for the rest of forever.</p><p><i>Author’s note: OMG…I can’t believe I did this. It’s so surreal to have this obsessive idea that won’t let go of my brain until I write it down. I’ve never written anything that wasn’t for a class before, and it has been a LONG time since I was in a class. It took me scores of minutes to figure out how to get the words from my word document to here and I don’t really understand tumblr or what happens after I hit “post.” I’m a little afraid to hit post at all, but here I go. </i></p></p>","content":"<p><h1>Passion Put to Use</h1><p><i>    I don&rsquo;t own AVATAR. Just playing in someone     else&rsquo;s sandbox.</i></p><p>Carefully the girl copies the last information she needs from the fragile scroll. Rising from the long table tucked into a secluded nook of the Ba Sing Se University Library, she deftly rolls the manuscript as she quickly crosses the quiet room. With a slight bow she returns the document to the elderly librarian sitting behind an imposingly ornate stone desk.</p><p>&ldquo;Not many people have an interest in this subject matter any more,&rdquo; the &nbsp;man comments, clearly bursting with curiosity as to why the young woman desires such obscure and antiquated volumes. Even in forward-thinking Ba Sing Se scholars of esoteric knowledge aren&rsquo;t often female.</p><p>The girl merely murmurs a noncommittal syllable that could be interpreted as agreement if one were feeling agreeable, or as disagreement if one weren&rsquo;t so inclined. With a second bow she turns and walks away.</p><p>Li Bao holds the returned scroll loosely in a hand that is age-spotted but still strong and well-manicured. &nbsp;He watches the mysterious figure depart. Though his interests don&rsquo;t tend in that direction and wouldn&rsquo;t even if he were a half century younger, the girl is undeniably lovely. Large eyes of an unusual blue contrast sharply with her dark complexion. She is tall, slim, and graceful. And completely inscrutable. Every few weeks she shows up and reads for hours, inevitably requesting books and scrolls that have lain untouched for decades. She speaks only when she wishes to request another tome and ignores the male appreciation she attracts from undergrads (and not a few faculty members).</p><p>Careful observation of library visitors over many years has made Bao an astute judge. He knows deep in his gut which patrons are likely to excise information they find objectionable, which will giggle over illustrated lovemaking manuals, and which smuggle in forbidden foodstuffs that will leave blots and crumbs. He makes a game of guessing into which category each new visitor falls as he encounters them. And, of course, he intervenes when necessary.  </p><p>Yet he can never decide where this girl fits. Her schedule is too erratic for a serious student, yet she has the manner of one. When approached by boys and men wishing to become better acquainted, she responds with icy silence. Yet he&rsquo;s seen her silently weeping over some of the volumes he retrieves for her. Other times her eyes clearly communicate a rage so deep it stops his breath. She&rsquo;s not as coldly indifferent as she often appears. These emotional responses seem at odds with her scholarly mien.</p><p>The girl&rsquo;s &nbsp;apathy over the copious male attention she receives first led Bao to guess that her interests also lay in her own sex or perhaps in none at all, but then he encountered her on the street in the Upper Ring with a young man.</p><p>Her cool demeanor was nowhere to be seen as she beamed and laughed up at him, cheeks rosy with joy and attraction, her hand entwined with her lover&rsquo;s. She pulled the boy into a recessed doorway and kissed him like she couldn&rsquo;t survive another moment without his touch. Despite his age and experience, Bao blushed at such naked longing. Though he couldn&rsquo;t see much of the boy because of a large-brimmed hat covering his hair and shading his eyes, every line of the young man&rsquo;s body declared his ardent return of the girl&rsquo;s interest. Bao had smiled widely, pleased that the too-grave-for-her-age young woman was not always serious or sad.</p><p>Bao&rsquo;s musing is interrupted by the adjust professor of bending theory, Chan Meili, as she slides a material request across the desk under his nose. Rather than immediately engaging Bao in rueful speculation over the library&rsquo;s other patrons as is her wont, Meili also stares after the departing figure of the girl.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Meili sighs, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen Master Katara up close before. Does she come here often?&rdquo;</p><p>Bao starts. &ldquo;Master Katara? She&rsquo;s a bending master? At that age?&rsquo;</p><p>Meili is shocked. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;ve never heard of Master Katara!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Til this moment I didn&rsquo;t even know her name.&rdquo;</p><p>Meili chuckles, &ldquo;You need to get out more, Bao! Master Katara helped save the world by defeating that crazy Fire Nation princess. &nbsp;And she&rsquo;s the Avatar&rsquo;s girlfriend.&rdquo; Meili drops her voice to a suggestive whisper, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re said to be quite disgustingly in love.&rdquo;</p><p>Oh. <i>Oh!</i></p><p>Suddenly the puzzle pieces constituting the girl slide into place. He feels a bit like crying himself as he realizes the reason for her intense reactions to reading about the long-gone Air Nomads.</p><p>&bull; &bull; &bull; &bull;</p><p>Katara hurries out of the library, tucking her notes into a large satchel slung over her shoulder. Glee suffuses her being as she finally drops her serious student facade and nearly dances along the street, plans percolating in her brain.</p><p>Three brief shopping stops later she&rsquo;s headed back to the Upper-Ring house that King Kuei formally gifted to Aang two years ago when Aang reached legal adulthood according to the customs of the Earth Kingdom. Katara made it her official residence after she accepted the lead healer position at the Ba Sing Se Healing Center shortly thereafter. Toph, Sokka, and Suki all maintain rooms in the house for their frequent visits to the city. Though Zuko and Mai often visit as well, political expedience keeps them closer to the palace when they stay in Ba Sing Se.</p><p>But today the house would only hold Aang and her. And she has big plans for the night to come.</p><p>Katara stashes her satchel under her writing desk after removing a few of her pages of notes and sketches. From a lower drawer she pulls a basket containing skeins of silk thread, beads, and a tiny steel hook. Looking down at her sketches, she carefully uses the hook to draw together silk strands into small loops that she then works into a complicated pattern. Occasionally she threads a tiny bead onto the tip of the hook and works it into the arrangement. Half an hour later she finishes. Her project is complete,threads snipped and loose ends sewn down. Katara tucks it into her pocket with a grin and stows her supplies back in the drawer.</p><p>Katara carries the notes and sketches into the kitchen. Checking the time-keeping candle, she notes that it&rsquo;s just past 3 o'candle. Before Aang left that &nbsp;morning he &nbsp;promised to return by 6 o'candle. She has never attempted any of the dishes planned for tonight, so she figures it&rsquo;s best to get started cooking.</p><p>&bull; &bull; &bull; &bull;</p><p>Aang is immediately surrounded by delicious aromas when he opens the front door of his house. Wonderingly, he stops in the doorway. Memories from his childhood fill his mind.</p><p>Gyatso ladles soup into his bowl. A crowd of air nomads enjoys a picnic on a grassy plain, kites blazing brilliant color above. Novitiates race through a courtyard on air scooters. Scores of air bison circle above his head. All with the same background scents he now experiences.</p><p>Katara hears Aang come in, but then there&rsquo;s silence. Confused, she heads toward the door. Aang is standing just inside, one hand still resting on the knob. He looks transfixed but his gaze is unfocused.</p><p>&ldquo;Sweetie?&rdquo; Katara asks.</p><p>With a small shake of his head, Aang smiles and pulls Katara into his arms. He drops a kiss onto the tip of her nose. Katara winds her arms around his shoulders and presses her lips to the edge of his jaw. Aang hums contentedly. They press together more closely and rest quietly in the embrace for a moment</p><p>Aang breaks the silence &ldquo;It smells wonderful in here!&rdquo; he enthuses, &ldquo;no sea prunes tonight?&rdquo;</p><p>Katara slaps his shoulder lightly and laughs. &ldquo;No sea prunes. Why don&rsquo;t you wash up and then you can see what we do have.&rdquo;</p><p>While Aang washes away the concerns of a day spent coaxing recalcitrant politicians into listening to each other, Katara arranges the food she prepared on their low table. She sits on a floor cushion and waits apprehensively, twisting her fingers together until she notices she&rsquo;s doing so. She grips the edge of the table instead, nerves rising.</p><p>Aang stands in the doorway behind Katara, a stunned look on his face.  </p><p>&ldquo;Katara, you made all this?&rdquo; he whispers.</p><p>Katara starts at his words, then babbles nervously. &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re here! Of course you&rsquo;re here. I just didn&rsquo;t hear you come in. Because you were behind me, obviously. And you&rsquo;re really light on your feet, you know. Toph may be onto something, calling you Twinkletoes. Do you think&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>Aang curtails the babbling by lifting her to her feet and pressing his lips to hers.

His hand brushing faintly against Katara&rsquo;s gloved pinky.</p><p>&ldquo;Avatar Aang!&rdquo; The two siblings then reacted one after the other in a somewhat awkward way.</p><p>The Avatar raised a breezy brow, chuckling. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up guys!&rdquo;</p><p>Nirliq, swiftly seeing the opportunity, grabbed ahold of Aang&rsquo;s wrist and tugged. &ldquo;I call the Avatar on my team!&rdquo;</p><p>Struck with some amount of disbelief and slow processing of the events occurring before her of the Avatar casually appearing just then, she eagerly grasped onto Katara&rsquo;s sleeve. &ldquo;Fine. I wanted to play with Master Katara anyways. Girls versus boys!&rdquo;</p><p>The elder fifteen and seventeen year old shared an ingenuous look and allowed themselves to be pulled apart, the lingering presence of their touching finger tips etching into their skins.</p><p>Qannik bunched a fistful of snow into both hands and carried her right hand over her head, tossing the snowball towards Nirliq as a sign of the exuberant session&rsquo;s beginnings. </p><p>The sounds of laughter, crunching snow and hefty breathing ricochet off the walls that separated them from the rest of the village and its people, those of intrigued ears peering in on the fun the Avatar and the Chieftain&rsquo;s daughter was informally having. </p><p>With an icy snow blast to the face however, the fight quickly turned heavyhearted as the wail from a young boy pierced through the pleasure that was had particularly between Aang and Katara. Dropping the snowballs they were no doubt about to shove in each other&rsquo;s faces in unison. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Katara started, the cry triggering something profoundly intrinsic within her.</p><p>Nirliq pointed his finger to Qannik, frowning. </p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo; Qannik instantly denied.</p><p>Katara gave the younger sibling a stern look, crossing her arms. &ldquo;Really now?&rdquo;</p><p>Nirliq, evidently frustrated with a turning crimson expression, picked himself up and shrieked. &ldquo;Yes you did! Ugh!&rdquo; And with that, he pushed his sister onto the ground, immediately regretting it as he saw the look of fright surface upon her face. Both hearing the loud tear of fabric echo throughout what seemed to be all of the arctic terrain.</p><p>&ldquo;What&hellip;just happened?&rdquo; Qannik incredulously asked. She looked up to her brother and then smirked.</p><p>&ldquo;Mom&rsquo;s going to kill me!&rdquo; Nirliq panicked, knowing full well of what number parka Qannik currently was on.</p><p>&ldquo;No one&rsquo;s going to kill anyone. Here.&rdquo; Katara took control by giving Qannik her parka, helping her into it and zipping it all the way up to her chin. &ldquo;Aang and I will walk you two home so Qannik could get a new one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You guys shouldn&rsquo;t be fighting in the first place. That&rsquo;s not how siblings should act, isn&rsquo;t that right sweetie?&rdquo; Aang joined in.</p><p>Helping Qannik dust off snow particles, Katara nodded in agreement. &ldquo;Right sweetie. I want you two to apologize to one another.&rdquo;</p><p>Qannik gasped. &ldquo;For what!&rdquo;</p><p>Katara kept on. &ldquo;You know what! You threw that snowball in his face, it must&rsquo;ve had ice in it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t know that.&rdquo; Qannik coyly defended herself.</p><p>&ldquo;Even so, it still hurt him.&rdquo; Katara stressed.</p><p>Qannik hesitantly caved. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Nirliq. I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt you.&rdquo; </p><p>Aang, pulling Katara closer so his lips were inches apart from her ear, whispered, &ldquo;Honestly, I think she knew.&rdquo;</p><p>Katara sniggered.</p><p>Without further prompting from Katara, Nirliq quickly apologized too. As if what happened just now didn&rsquo;t, a suggestion from Qannik about something related to penguins left the siblings going off to somewhere else in a flash.</p><p>The young woman couldn&rsquo;t help the genuine upturn of her lips at the sight of the two children&rsquo;s shrinking backs. So caught up in the moment, she almost never heard the sound of her lover&rsquo;s voice next to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Katara, aren&rsquo;t you cold?&rdquo; Aang had pondered aloud with worry.</p><p>She hadn&rsquo;t noticed her instinctive gloved touch to both elbows as she crossed her arms, feeling a chill run through her as she squeezed her arms tighter, tiny little hills building on her exposed skin. &ldquo;O-o-oh. I&hellip;a-am.&rdquo;</p><p>Aang didn&rsquo;t like the sound and feel of her voice and body quivering. &ldquo;Just breathe slowly. In for eight seconds, then out for four. Join me, Katara.&rdquo; Aang guided calmly.</p><p>She tried her very best to follow along, knowing that what he was teaching her could help with the impossible chills she currently was feeling (and how she wished in that moment she asked how exactly in excruciating detail he didn&rsquo;t feel the need for a parka sooner). In a deplorable move made by the weather spirits however, a persistent breeze picked up around them, causing her violent shakes to increase in its intensity.</p><p>&ldquo;A-ang, this&hellip;this is&hellip;not&hellip;working!&rdquo; Katara shakily let out, mildly irritated.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, sweetie. Oh, I know!&rdquo; Aang lift open his tunic cardigan, dragging his feet closer to envelope her in his arms and wrap his garments around her.</p><p>The languid thumping of his heart sent a calming course of bliss through her nerves, the last of her shivers expelling from her body as she breathed in his scent, closing her eyes and sighing. Pulling him tightly against her, she said incoherently, &ldquo;This is nice.&rdquo;</p><p>Yet, Aang somehow heard her with the the wind blowing strongly and her mouth muffled by his broader than before chest. &ldquo;It is. Wait, you&rsquo;re not cold anymore?&rdquo;</p><p>Katara scrunched up her nose, the smile she gave up to Aang left her eyes almost completely closed, evidence of just how content she truly was. &ldquo;I am still a little. Any moment I get to spend with you though is a nice one, sweetie.&rdquo;</p><p>Aang made a sound of pleasant concurrence, tightening his grip around her.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been so long since we&rsquo;ve been together like this. We haven&rsquo;t had time with each other since we came back to the southern water tribe. I pictured time together being a little more warm, however.&rdquo; Katara murmured. </p><p>Aang laughed then, burying his face in her hair. The familiar scent and feel of it still fresh in his mind and it gave him comfort that it was just the same as he remembered. </p><p>&ldquo;Way warmer.&rdquo; Katara added on, shivering slightly as the wind picked up once more.</p><p>A strong blush found its way onto the Avatar&rsquo;s face as he interpreted those words. &ldquo;We should really start heading back then.&rdquo;</p><p>Katara, hearing the increased thumping of his heartbeat, started giggling softly. &ldquo;I agree, but let&rsquo;s stay here for a little while. Our home&rsquo;s not going anywhere.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Aang squeaked, positively smitten. Haven&rsquo;t had done that in months.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Aang in his flustered state was the intentional choice of words from Katara of where they definitely had to go, since this moment after all really couldn&rsquo;t have last forever.</p>","body_abstract":"\n<blockquote><p><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/25639372/chapters/62242039\">A03</a> | <a href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13659337/1/Intrinsically-Yours\">FF.Net</a> | <a href=\"https://www.wattpad.com/story/234709834-intrinsically-yours\">Wattpad</a></b></p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Date Published:</b> Friday, the 31th day of July</p>\n<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> I do not own ATLA or its characters.

As if what happened just now didn’t, a suggestion from Qannik about something related to penguins left the siblings going off to somewhere else in a flash.</p><p>The young woman couldn’t help the genuine upturn of her lips at the sight of the two children’s shrinking backs. So caught up in the moment, she almost never heard the sound of her lover’s voice next to her.</p><p>“Katara, aren’t you cold?” Aang had pondered aloud with worry.</p><p>She hadn’t noticed her instinctive gloved touch to both elbows as she crossed her arms, feeling a chill run through her as she squeezed her arms tighter, tiny little hills building on her exposed skin. “O-o-oh. I…a-am.”</p><p>Aang didn’t like the sound and feel of her voice and body quivering. “Just breathe slowly. In for eight seconds, then out for four. Join me, Katara.” Aang guided calmly.</p><p>She tried her very best to follow along, knowing that what he was teaching her could help with the impossible chills she currently was feeling (and how she wished in that moment she asked how exactly in excruciating detail he didn’t feel the need for a parka sooner). In a deplorable move made by the weather spirits however, a persistent breeze picked up around them, causing her violent shakes to increase in its intensity.</p><p>“A-ang, this…this is…not…working!” Katara shakily let out, mildly irritated.</p><p>“I’m sorry, sweetie. Oh, I know!” Aang lift open his tunic cardigan, dragging his feet closer to envelope her in his arms and wrap his garments around her.</p><p>The languid thumping of his heart sent a calming course of bliss through her nerves, the last of her shivers expelling from her body as she breathed in his scent, closing her eyes and sighing. Pulling him tightly against her, she said incoherently, “This is nice.”</p><p>Yet, Aang somehow heard her with the the wind blowing strongly and her mouth muffled by his broader than before chest. “It is. Wait, you’re not cold anymore?”</p><p>Katara scrunched up her nose, the smile she gave up to Aang left her eyes almost completely closed, evidence of just how content she truly was. “I am still a little. Any moment I get to spend with you though is a nice one, sweetie.”</p><p>Aang made a sound of pleasant concurrence, tightening his grip around her.</p><p>“It’s been so long since we’ve been together like this.

But alas, a few knives and smoke bombs were no match for the Avatar, his Waterbending master, and the only male Kyoshi warrior to have existed. Katara guesses she’s just frustrated that they’d have to deal with fighting so early into their trip. She wanted to get back home to the Southern Watertribe as fast as she could, but from where she’s standing, she could still see the smoke from the Fire Nation capital. </p><p>Aang walks up to her right as Sokka starts to gather their belongings that had fallen from Appa’s saddle. “Hey, do we have time? There are some berries here, I’m just gonna go pluck some for Appa.”</p><p>“Thanks Sokka,” Aang calls out as the elder makes himself busy. He turns to Katara. “Sweetie, my back’s a little sticky. Can you check—”</p><p>But Katara’s hands are already pushing him to lie on the ground before he finishes his sentence. “Don’t try to get up. You’re hurt.”</p><p>Her eyes are wide with fear, clearly on red alert as she inspects the blood on his back. He’s hurt, she repeats in her head. He’d been hurt and she hadn’t realized. How could she let that slip past her? She checks for the source of the wound, pulling frantically at his robes, and sighs in relief when she finds a shallow cut at the back of his bicep.</p><p>She bends the water from her pouch and immediately gets to work. She thinks about how he could bleed so much from a small cut. It rouses so much sudden fury within her, she gets more and more aggressive in her healing as she thinks about the blood. Aang’s blood.</p><p>“Katara?” Aang questions as he rises to a sitting position. He looks so confused. “It’s just a cut.” He sounds like he’s trying to console a child, and she hates it. “Nothing too deep, and not much blood either.”</p><p>But that’s the thing. The first time it had happened, there was no blood at all. Just his cold, lifeless body draped in her arms. The blood she sees today only reminds her that he’s human. Fragile. He could so easily slip away from her grasp.</p><p>It takes a while, because she has to shake the thought off, but she nods in reply. Even then she doesn’t stop trying to close the wound with her healing. Though it’s hard to focus with her vision blurred.</p><p>Aang lifts a hand to her own, closing his fingers around the back of one of her palms. There’s debris on his hands from lying on the ground. Gently, he asks, “Sweetie, why are you crying?”</p><p>She flinches as if he’d struck her, stopping her healing at once and letting the water fall between them. Both their clothing is soaked, but that comes secondary to Aang as he watches Katara’s face crumple in a split second. She snatches her hands back and sobs into them, giving into all of her emotions.</p><p>Though he doesn’t understand, he brings her into his arms all the same. The tone he uses when he asks her what’s wrong breaks her heart. “You’re only sixteen,” she whimpers pathetically, as if that explains everything.</p><p>It doesn’t.</p><p>“Yes,” he affirms, but he still can’t make sense of what’s gotten her so shaken. “And you’re barely eighteen.”</p><p>Katara gulps. It makes her feel so hollow to have to say what she’s going to say, knowing that he can’t do anything to abate these fears. The almighty Avatar could bring peace and restore balance, defeat the once ruthless Firelord, end the century long war, but cannot wash away the worries of a teenage girl. She knows this without a doubt because her fear is inevitable, and will happen one way or another.</p><p>Except this fear feels more like a wound, like she’s punctured a lung. When Azula struck Aang that day, she must have struck some part of Katara, too. Because she feels like she&rsquo;s bleeding all over inside. And she feels this way every time she sees the love of her life hurt in any shape or form.</p><p>She looks at him, torn. But she says the words anyway. “I can’t watch you die again. I can’t. It’ll destroy me.”</p><p>His eyes soften then, smiling at her. She doesn’t understand how he can feel so at peace in this moment, when she’d just spoken her greatest fear into the world.</p><p>Aang pushes her hair out of her face and wipes at her tears. It makes her feel loved, but it doesn’t stop the shaking in her hands in the slightest. “You won’t have to,” he says at long last. </p><p>“How could you possibly say that? You can’t know, Aang, how you’ll—” She can’t even say it. The thought of it, of having to see him cold and still and helpless in her arms yet again makes her want to vomit. </p><p>“I know because you’re Katara, the world’s greatest healer.”</p><p>“I’m not—” But he cuts her off before she can finish.</p><p>“You’re the only healer to have brought me back from the dead. To have brought back <i>any</i> Avatar from the dead.” He holds both her hands in his. “And you’ll always be by my side to save me. Like you did that day, and today.” He says it so simply, in the way that he always does. “Why would I have to worry?”</p><p>He kisses the apple of her left cheek, framing her face in his palms. “What do <i>you</i> have to worry, when you hold these abilities?” She sniffles but it comes out more like a laugh, feeling the anxiety dwindle. “Katara,” Aang starts more resolutely, “We’re not running on borrowed time. Trust me when I say I’ll be staying with you for a long, long time. You couldn’t rid yourself of me if you tried.”</p><p>“I love you,” she says, because that’s all she can fathom as the reassurance settles in her calming heart. Perhaps she’d underestimated the mighty Avatar’s abilities. He was capable of chasing her fears away after all.</p><p>“I love you, too,” he says, kissing her.</p><p>They bask in each other’s embrace, contented, before Aang breaks the silence once again. “And I know you, Sweetie.” She looks up at his gray eyes. “If I even thought about leaving before my time, you’d drag my soul back here from the Spirit world yourself.”</p><p>She lets herself laugh then. “Don’t make me do it again.”</p><p>“Do what again?” comes Sokka’s voice. He turns to them with a handful of berries and makes a wretched sound, covering his eyes exaggeratedly. “Ugh!

And she feels this way every time she sees the love of her life hurt in any shape or form.</p><p>She looks at him, torn. But she says the words anyway. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t watch you die again. I can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;ll destroy me.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes soften then, smiling at her. She doesn&rsquo;t understand how he can feel so at peace in this moment, when she&rsquo;d just spoken her greatest fear into the world.</p><p>Aang pushes her hair out of her face and wipes at her tears. It makes her feel loved, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop the shaking in her hands in the slightest. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; he says at long last.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How could you possibly say that? You can&rsquo;t know, Aang, how you&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo; She can&rsquo;t even say it. The thought of it, of having to see him cold and still and helpless in her arms yet again makes her want to vomit.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I know because you&rsquo;re Katara, the world&rsquo;s greatest healer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not&mdash;&rdquo; But he cuts her off before she can finish.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only healer to have brought me back from the dead. To have brought back <i>any</i> Avatar from the dead.&rdquo; He holds both her hands in his. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll always be by my side to save me. Like you did that day, and today.&rdquo; He says it so simply, in the way that he always does. &ldquo;Why would I have to worry?&rdquo;</p><p>He kisses the apple of her left cheek, framing her face in his palms. &ldquo;What do <i>you</i> have to worry, when you hold these abilities?&rdquo; She sniffles but it comes out more like a laugh, feeling the anxiety dwindle. &ldquo;Katara,&rdquo; Aang starts more resolutely, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not running on borrowed time. Trust me when I say I&rsquo;ll be staying with you for a long, long time. You couldn&rsquo;t rid yourself of me if you tried.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; she says, because that&rsquo;s all she can fathom as the reassurance settles in her calming heart. Perhaps she&rsquo;d underestimated the mighty Avatar&rsquo;s abilities. He was capable of chasing her fears away after all.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, too,&rdquo; he says, kissing her.</p><p>They bask in each other&rsquo;s embrace, contented, before Aang breaks the silence once again. &ldquo;And I know you, Sweetie.&rdquo; She looks up at his gray eyes. &ldquo;If I even thought about leaving before my time, you&rsquo;d drag my soul back here from the Spirit world yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>She lets herself laugh then. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me do it again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do what again?&rdquo; comes Sokka&rsquo;s voice. He turns to them with a handful of berries and makes a wretched sound, covering his eyes exaggeratedly. &ldquo;Ugh! Oogies!&rdquo;</p>","content_abstract":"<p>\n<p><b>For Kataang Week 2020</b>.<br /></p>\n<p><b>Day 3: </b>Blood/Wounds</p>\n<p><b>Words: </b>1256 words</p>\n<p><b>Summary:</b>   Katara deals with Aang&rsquo;s wounds and opens up about one of her own.   </p>\n<p><b>Author&rsquo;s note:</b> Not really happy with this because I know I can fine-tune it more, but I&rsquo;m posting it before I chicken out and lose the momentum of my writing.</p>\n</p>","is_current_item":true,"is_root_item":true}],"can_like":false,"can_reblog":false,"can_send_in_message":true,"can_reply":false,"display_avatar":true},{"type":"link","blog_name":"fangirl-screaming","blog":{"name":"fangirl-screaming","title":"help girl i can feel my life crumbling to pieces","description":"she/they • multifandom dumpster fire • art & writing [unprofessional] • shitposts •  infp • please reblog my stuff • <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/users/fangirl_screaming\">ao3!</a> • <a href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/u/13222296/\">ffn!</a>\n •","url":"https://fangirl-screaming.tumblr.com/","uuid":"t:AFc8EMSxdZcs735NSjokJg","updated":1618776867},"id":"624973771597643776","id_string":"624973771597643776","post_url":"https://fangirl-screaming.tumblr.com/post/624973771597643776/not-over-yet-fangirlscreaming-avatar-the","slug":"not-over-yet-fangirlscreaming-avatar-the","date":"2020-07-29 11:17:14 GMT","timestamp":1596021434,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"WlJKtoHC","tags":["kataang week 2020","kataangtag","kataang","katara","aang"],"short_url":"https://tmblr.co/ZZORuUYiMbM20u00","summary":"Not Over Yet - fangirl_screaming - Avatar: The Last Airbender [Archive of Our Own]","should_open_in_legacy":true,"recommended_source":null,"recommended_color":null,"note_count":18,"title":"Not Over Yet - fangirl_screaming - Avatar: The Last Airbender [Archive of Our Own]","url":"https://archiveofourown.org/works/25589218","link_author":"Organization for Transformative Works","excerpt":"An Archive of Our Own, a project of the Organization for Transformative Works","publisher":"archiveofourown.org","description":"<p>Day 3 ~ Blood/Wounds</p>","reblog":{"comment":"<p>Day 3 ~ Blood/Wounds</p>","tree_html":""},"trail":[{"blog":{"name":"fangirl-screaming","active":true,"theme":{"header_full_width":2289,"header_full_height":865,"avatar_shape":"circle","background_color":"#F6F6F6","body_font":"Helvetica Neue","header_bounds":"","header_image":"https://64.media.tumblr.com/208cbe5831d2a5abca99e9d5226ac7aa/4ab492564e4f8cc5-ea/s2289x865/2992e5388f936e736ab5d3de3413009f6e6c9208.jpg","header_image_focused":"https://64.media.tumblr.com/208cbe5831d2a5abca99e9d5226ac7aa/4ab492564e4f8cc5-ea/s2048x3072/78f599a85ffb50ecf80491b4a0c244af9e51919a.jpg","header_image_poster":"","header_image_scaled":"https://64.media.tumblr.com/208cbe5831d2a5abca99e9d5226ac7aa/4ab492564e4f8cc5-ea/s2048x3072/78f599a85ffb50ecf80491b4a0c244af9e51919a.jpg","header_stretch":true,"link_color":"#FFE26B","show_avatar":true,"show_description":true,"show_header_image":true,"show_title":true,"title_color":"#000000","title_font":"Calluna","title_font_weight":"bold"},"share_likes":false,"share_following":false,"can_be_followed":true},"post":{"id":"624973771597643776"},"content_raw":"<p>Day 3 ~ Blood/Wounds</p>","content":"<p>Day 3 ~ Blood/Wounds</p>","is_current_item":true,"is_root_item":true}],"can_like":false,"can_reblog":false,"can_send_in_message":true,"can_reply":false,"display_avatar":true}]
